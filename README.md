# Stock-Market-News-Monitor
The news monitor is made to filter out articles, news reports or any live market updates by scrapping through multiple news outlet (which  is editable). The maximum efficiency is attained through your best tags and market websites which you want to integrate according to your preference. This monitor can be edited with all types of intruments in the financial markets and can be used both domestic and international markets. 
It functions in way that it stores all the news data which is already displayed once and doesn't repeat the particular news in a .json file.
It also generates pdf files for a particular article/blog to get into a better context.
